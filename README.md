# eSport Ontology

The eSports Ontology is an ontology for the description of eSports and related events. 
The main purpose for this ontology is to get organized data about different eSports (associated game description), its players and events. 
The eSports Ontology was also designed to store everything in a eSport match or an tournament that could be of interest to eSports betting. 

An ontology is a formalization of concepts and relations within a domain. eSportOntology is written in RDF and OWL.

You can find more documentation (in spanish) in the [documentation folder](doc).


## Getting Started

There are two ways to work with the ontology:


### 1. Visualize the Ontology
Visualize the ontology using [WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/).
WebVOWL is also developed on GitHub: https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL.
[eSportsOntology](src/Ontologies/eSportsOntology.owl) needs to be uploaded to WebVOWL.

### 2. Open the ontology in Protégé
Download [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/) and open the ontology file to browse around and view all assertions.
